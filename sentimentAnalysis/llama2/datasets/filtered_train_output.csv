Also many items from 3RD Party sellers seem to be fictitious and counterfeit. I literally LOVE Amazon but they need to get rid of 3RD Party sellers who take advantage of people by selling items at 50-75% more than any retail price.,3,1,24.21.4.100,2022-11-25 11:53:09,,,24.21.4.100,1,465,en

Nevermind what i ordered is very much needed. A refund doesn't fix my need for toilet paper or coffee right then. Amazons issue is how they hire people. They do it when desperate rather than steady hiring as needed which would solve learning ambassador wondering n late packages.,3,0,24.12.6.100,2022-07-09 06:09:54,,,24.12.6.100,1,495,en
