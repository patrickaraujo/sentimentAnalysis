I like the notifications on deliveries. I don't use my phone extensively for shopping or making purchases but I do wish they would include fingerprint identification to access your account as an additional security measure.

The app has limited storage. When storage reaches that limit it slows down or stops. Clearing the cache isn't enough. You have to clear storage if app starts slowing down and/or after each time you use it. Amazon needs to reduce file sizes to decrease needed storage and also offer automatic storage clearing at close of app option.,4,26,24.12.6.100,2022-07-20 15:22:51,,,24.12.6.100,2,465,en

An awesome update I would suggest..... make it so you can either ""move"" or ""delete"" multiple items from a list at one time. So if there is a lot of things you need to move to another list or delete you can do it MUCH easier than having to go through one by one. The lists glitch for me quite a bit too. Where things won't move or delete or it won't let me scroll through the list.",3,0,24.20.2.100,2022-11-01 12:15:28,,,24.20.2.100,1,417,en
