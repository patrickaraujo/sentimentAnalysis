9658,14394,14394,d41e0a27-02df-422d-b3b6-1e9f3cdd5911,I've had Amazon Prime for a few years now and I use Fresh regularly. Overall I've been super satisfied with Amazon's customer service (excellent return policy on most products) and the free shipping. I personally think that Prime should be under $10/month given how massive the company is. I also REALLY dislike how much I have to spend now to get free delivery on my Fresh groceries. I really wish we could tip from our foostamp cards too. Overall though I'm still a loyal Amazon customer.,4,4,26.15.0.100,2023-08-10 10:54:39,,,26.15.0.100,2,490,en

The only bad thing is they raised the price limit from$25 up to $35 in order to get free shipping. You only get free shipping on certain items. I've made a lot of Amazon purchases but not enough to pay for Amazon prime every month. Some months go by that I can't make any purchases but I'd still have to pay for prime. And yet still not get free shipping on certain items. I just recently purchased a mattress in a box. Its almost here.,5,11,26.23.4.100,2024-01-03 07:46:43,,,26.23.4.100,2,499,en

Their Prime Day used to be a great time to score good deals for established brands, but now it's all a scam. I had just looked up a product I was interested in and saved it, price was 31.99€. Shortly before the Prime Day it jumped to 38.99€, but you got a voucher of 20% applied to every one of these items sold, making the price the same. Now the Prime Day price is 32.99€.

Never doing business with this company again and would highly suggest buying from a better site like eBay. Had we known this is how this company does business we would have never bought anything from them. Hopefully the Better Business bureau will help.,1,1,,2024-01-08 20:39:04,,,,0,465,en

14189,20099,20099,1b4725f5-fa29-41e4-99d2-867efbedbe60,Love Amazon But Unfortunately there are many items on Amazon that are ridiculously overpriced from 3RD Party sellers so an item that you would normally purchase for $10 can have an inflated price of $75 so thats how ridiculous it is. Also many items from 3RD Party sellers seem to be fictitious and counterfeit. I literally LOVE Amazon but they need to get rid of 3RD Party sellers who take advantage of people by selling items at 50-75% more than any retail price.,3,1,24.21.4.100,2022-11-25 11:53:09,,,24.21.4.100,1,465,en
